# Scanning Documents with Perspective Transformation using Python OpenCV

• Preprocessed images by resizing, converting to grayscale, and applying Gaussian blur.

• Performed edge detection using the Canny algorithm and extracted contours, selecting the largest quadrilateral
contour.

• Reordered contour points and applied perspective transformation for a top-down document view.

• Converted the transformed image to grayscale, applied Gaussian blur, and displayed the results.

Technologies Used: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook
